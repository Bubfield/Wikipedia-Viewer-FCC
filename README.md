# Wikipedia-Viewer-FCC
This is a project inspired by freeCodeCamp's "Build a Wikipedia Viewer" from their "Take Home Projects" course. What I built is mostly the same as theirs as far as functionality, besides that I haven't yet figured out how to implement the responsive search bar and responsive "x" icon that is present in the FCC example project. I'll try to implement it at some point. I'm also not sure what libraries were used in the example project but I just used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. At some point I may come back to this project and use React to build it.
